make a portfolio in canva in an hour - make it a 4000 px x 6000 px canvas and add a couple projects you did in school or early career. use an image or two from google search (think collage) and explain what you did and why you think it's important for us to know. include some thoughts about what you learned, why you're successful, and why you want to be a product manager - in general, not just at superaffective

don't spend more than a day on the portfolio - it shouldn't take a week. draft some thoughts in google docs, and then get started. use copy-paste click-drag from google image search to add your favorite ideas to the portfolio. write a paragraph for each project/idea and include in the canva. style the images next to each other. if you don't know how to arrange the portfolio project pieces, just keep them in a row. 4-6 is enough. if you only have 1-2, think harder about the projects you can showcase. it can be a class you liked like psychology, cognitive science, or engineering 🙂

instead of a resume, here's what we want 🙂

write in one paragraph.

- name, first name last name

- list your current address where you're living - we just want to know where you are in the world. list your exact address, where you receive deliveries. we'll need this to send you cool stuff and help you become a product manager 🙂

- list your current job title, if you have one. list your most recent jobs, and the dates for when you worked for them. try to include official job title even if you didn't like it 🙂 it's usually in the offer letter 🙂 if you didn't work yet, no problem 🙂

- list where you went to school - should be a top school. we require a top college degree - no self-taught product managers here. should be an engineering education - our other two L3s received engineering degrees from UCLA and Stanford, and one has a PhD in computer science CS (that's Ashley 🙂 ) 🙂 - any engineering major ok, including CS - it's a degree. include the years you started and graduated college. master's degrees are welcome 🙂 

- list in one or two sentences where you grew up, and your favorite home town. for example "I grew up in Los Angeles, and loved going to Santa Monica Beach and the local Santa Monica mall. it was fun to walk around and hang out with my friends 🙂"

- list your age. it should be 22 - 25. if you haven't graduated yet, or you're over 25, this job is not for you. we won't consider you 🙂
